NLP-Assignment-1---Text-Pipeline-Tokenization-Stopwords-Stemming-Lemmatization-
This repository contains Assignment 1 of the SEC-D NLP assignment.
The goal of this project is to apply a complete NLP preprocessing pipeline on a custom paragraph and print results at every step.

📘 Project Overview
This project performs the following steps:

🔹 1. Tokenization
Splitting a paragraph into individual words (tokens) so the computer can process text easily.

🔹 2. Stopword Removal
Removing common words like the, is, am, in, etc. that do not add meaningful information.

🔹 3. Stemming
Reducing words to their root form by cutting off prefixes/suffixes.
Example: playing → play, studies → studi

🔹 4. Lemmatization
Converting words to their dictionary base form using grammatical rules.
Example: studies → study, better → good
